Brieâ€™s Drawing teacher asks her class to open their -page book to page number . Brie can either start turning pages from the front of the book (i.e., page number ) or from the back of the book (i.e., page number ), and she always turns pages one-by-one (as opposed to skipping through multiple pages at once). When she opens the book, page  is always on the right side:

Each page in the book has two sides, front and back, except for the last page which may only have a front side depending on the total number of pages of the book (see the Explanation sections below for additional diagrams).

Given  and , find and print the minimum number of pages Brie must turn in order to arrive at page .

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of pages in the book. 
The second line contains an integer, , denoting the page that Brie's teacher wants her to turn to.

Constraints

Output Format

Print an integer denoting the minimum number of pages Brie must turn to get to page .
