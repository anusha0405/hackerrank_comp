Program:
Leonardo thinks  and  are lucky digits! He defines a number as lucky if it can be represented as the sum of one or more of these lucky digits. For example, he considers the following numbers to be lucky:

You are given  queries, where each query consists of a long integer denoting . For each query, print Yes on a new line if  is a lucky number; otherwise, print No.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer denoting . 
Each of the  subsequent lines contains a long integer describing the value of  for a query.

Constraints

Subtasks

 for  of the maximum score
Output Format

For each query, print Yes on a new line if  is a lucky number; otherwise, print No.

Sample Input

4
1
4
11
17
Sample Output

No
Yes
Yes
No
Explanation

We perform the following  queries:

 can't be represented as a sum of 's and 's, so we print No on a new line.
 is a lucky digit (which means it's also a lucky number), so we print Yes on a new line.
 can be represented as , so we print Yes on a new line.
 can't be represented as a sum of 's and 's, so we print No on a new line.
