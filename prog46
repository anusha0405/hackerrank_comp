Program:
Lily likes to play games with integers and their reversals. For some integer , we define  to be the reversal of all digits in . For example, , , and .

Logan wants to go to the movies with Lily on some day  satisfying , but he knows she only goes to the movies on days she considers to be beautiful. Lily considers a day to be beautiful if the absolute value of the difference between  and  is evenly divisible by .

Given , , and , count and print the number of beautiful days when Logan and Lily can go to the movies.

Input Format

A single line of three space-separated integers describing the respective values of , , and .

Constraints

Output Format

Print the number of beautiful days in the inclusive range between  and .

Sample Input

20 23 6
Sample Output

2
Explanation

Logan wants to go to the movies on days , , , and . We perform the following calculations to determine which days are beautiful:

Day  is beautiful because the following evaluates to a whole number: 
Day  is not beautiful because the following doesn't evaluate to a whole number: 
Day  is beautiful because the following evaluates to a whole number: 
Day  is not beautiful because the following doesn't evaluate to a whole number: 
Only two days,  and , in this interval are beautiful. Thus, we print  as our answer.
