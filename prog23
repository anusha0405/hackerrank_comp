Program:
We call an array of integers tight if every pair of adjacent integers in the array has an absolute difference . For example, the array  is tight, but the array  is not:

Illustration of tight arrays.

The diagram above shows the absolute differences between each pair of adjacent elements. Note that the second array is not tight, because it has a pair of adjacent elements whose absolute difference is greater than .

Given , , and , complete the function below by returning the length of the shortest tight array such that the first element is , the last element is , and the array contains .

Input Format

Three space-separated integers describing the respective values of , , and .

Constraints

Output Format

Return a single integer denoting the length of the shortest tight array such that the first element is , the last element is , and the array contains the element .
