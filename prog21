program:
Given two times,  and , in the 12-hour AM/PM format, we want to know which time occurs first during a day. For example, if  is 08:02PM and  is 06:51AM, then  occurs before .

Solve  queries where each query consists of some  and . For each query, print First if  occurs before ; otherwise, print Second.

Note: The day starts at 12:00AM (midnight) and ends at 11:59PM. The time 12:00PM denotes noon (midday).

Input Format

The first line contains an integer denoting  (the number of queries). 
Each of the  subsequent lines contains two space-separated strings describing the respective values of  and .

Constraints

Output Format

For each query, print First if  occurs before ; otherwise, print Second.

Note: If using the given code stubs, complete the function so that it returns the appropriate string.

Sample Input 0

2
10:19PM 02:49AM
08:49AM 09:10AM
Sample Output 0

Second
First
Explanation 0

We perform the following  queries:

 is 10:19PM and  is 02:49AM. Because AM always occurs before PM, we know that  occurs earlier and we print Second.
 is 08:49AM and  is 09:10AM.
 Both times occur during the AM (first half of the day), so we compare their hours. Because , we know that 
 occurs earlier and we print First.
